Armand Vitesse serves as a self-managed area for do-it-yourself projects, repairs, crafting, and self-education. This space is situated in a garage of a house and is provided at no cost. All offerings are available on a pay-what-you-want model. The space is operated by individuals who choose to get involved voluntarily. Armand Vitesse is not classified as an association.

This initiative focuses on mutual aid, aimed at assisting individuals with limited financial means in maintaining and repairing their bicycles, phones, computers, small appliances, clothing, and more. Additionally, it seeks to foster knowledge sharing and collective learning within a supportive and inclusive atmosphere. Our goal is to enhance solidarity among participants and derive strength from it!

We aim for this space to be inclusive and for everyone to feel invited. We remain attentive to our behaviors and attitudes to avoid replicating the injustices that anger us in other places (racism, sexism, ableism, and all forms of oppression).

If you are interested in joining a workshop, suggesting a new one (such as drawing, languages, or any other topic you prefer!), or simply enjoying a coffee with others, you are warmly invited! Looking forward to seeing you soon at Armand Vitesse!
